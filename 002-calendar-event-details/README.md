## Challenging list

- Style the boxes in the right and left using flex-box
- Create the triangle tip for the tooltip with a smooth border
- show and hide the tooltip on hover without messing with layout

## More explanations

- if you understand Arabic here is a link for a [youtube video](#) explaining the steps I took to implement that challenge,
- but if you don't understand Arabic don't worry here is a [blog post](#) in English which should be helpful in understanding.
